        <h1>The 7 New Rules for the 2025 Season</h1>
        <h2>The breakdown on each rule</h2> 
       <h3>3V3 Structure</h3>
           <p> Requires a minimum of 3 outfield players in each half at all times. the goalkeep is 
          not included in this, if a player leaves this structure the team will be penalised by
          the oppsoing to getting s free kick. This is introduced as a way to cut down on the 
          blanket defense and all or nothing approach.</p>
        <h3>Solo & Go</h3>
            <p> The idea of the solo and go is to contiune the flow of the game. Essentially when a 
          player is fouled they are awarded a free kick but not permitted to contiune without 
        the referees permission. However now they can contuine with a immediate toe-tap within in 4m 
        of where the foul was and cannot be challeged by the opposition until they have take their 
        first play. The solo and go is not permitted inside the opponets 20m line.  </p>
