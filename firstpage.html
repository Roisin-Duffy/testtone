        <h1>The New Rules for the 2025 Season</h1>
        <h2>The breakdown on each rule</body></h2>
        <h3><b>1v1 Throw In</b></h3>
        <p>Coming away from the traditional throw up with two midfielders contesting the ball,
          Instead the referee will now throw the ball up to one player from each team and the 
          other two midfielders will start the game from either side of the sideline.
          This aims to eliminate the constant fouling that occurs with the throw up.</p>
        <h3><Kick-Outs</h3>
        <p>With the restart of a game coming from either a score or a wide the goalkeeper is 
          not required to have to wait for the players to leave the 20 meter line before
           the ball is kicked, But now players must be out of the 13 meter line for the Kickout 
          This is to increase pace in the game</p>
