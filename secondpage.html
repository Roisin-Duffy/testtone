        <h1>The 7 New Rules for the 2025 Season</h1>
        <h2>The breakdown on each rule</h2> 
        <h3>Goalkeeper Backpass</h3>
        <p>Goalkeepers can now only recieve the ball back if both players are in the
           large rectangle of their own goal and was played in by a player from the opposite
            team or if they crossover into the oppostions half to support the attack.
          This is to encourage both teams to move the ball forward. </p>
        <h3>40M Scoring Arc 2pointers</h3>
        <p>Pitches will now have an additional new arc coming from the 20m line extenting
           out from goal, When a ball is kicked from outside this arc by a player it is now
          going to be rewarded with 2 points instead of one. Referees will now identify this is
          a score by raising his two hands in the air and umpires will wave a orane flag to 
          acknowledge the 2 point score. A 45 is still worth 1 point.This is to encourage the
          long range shots to be taken.</p>
